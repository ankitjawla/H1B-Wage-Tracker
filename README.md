# H1B Wage Tracker

An interactive county-level choropleth map for exploring U.S. prevailing wages by occupation and wage level using official Department of Labor data. This application helps H1B visa applicants, employers, and immigration professionals understand prevailing wage requirements across different U.S. counties.

## 🎯 Features

- 🗺️ **Interactive Map**: Explore wage levels across all U.S. counties with an intuitive choropleth visualization
- 📊 **Real-time Statistics**: View coverage statistics showing how many counties match each wage level
- 🔍 **Occupation Search**: Search by job title or SOC (Standard Occupational Classification) code with autocomplete
- 💰 **Salary Calculator**: Input your annual salary to see which wage level applies in each county (with debounced input for better performance)
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- 🎨 **Color-coded Visualization**: Blue color palette for easy-to-understand wage level visualization
- 📍 **County Details**: Click on any county to see detailed wage level information
- ⌨️ **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space to toggle panel, Esc to collapse)
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with ARIA labels and proper focus management
- 💾 **State Persistence**: Panel collapse state persists across page reloads
- 🎭 **Smooth Animations**: Polished UI with smooth transitions and animations
- 🔗 **Shareable Views**: The selected occupation and salary are encoded in the URL (`?soc=&salary=`) so any view can be bookmarked or shared
- 📊 **Data Explorer**: A dedicated overlay for exploring **LCA (H-1B)**, **PERM (green card)**, and **USCIS** disclosure data — by employer, occupation, location, wage percentile, and approval rate

## 📊 Data Explorer (LCA / PERM / USCIS)

Beyond the prevailing-wage map, the app includes a **Data Explorer** (the floating 📊 button) for
the broader public immigration datasets, with five tabs:

| Tab | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Overview** | Totals across all loaded datasets and top states by filing volume |
| **Employers** | Search any sponsor → their H-1B (LCA), PERM, and USCIS petition history, top occupations, and wage percentiles |
| **PERM** | Permanent labor certification (green card) filings by year, status, employer, and occupation |
| **Salary Insights** | Real *filed* wage distributions (percentiles) from LCA data, plus where a given salary ranks |
| **USCIS Approvals** | Approval / denial counts and rates from the USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub |

### Data sources & freshness

These datasets are **periodic public releases — not real-time**:

- **DOL OFLC LCA & PERM disclosure data** — released quarterly ([DOL Performance Data](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/performance))
- **USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub** — released annually ([USCIS Data Hub](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/reports-and-studies/h-1b-employer-data-hub))

### Backend setup (Neon via Vercel)

The Explorer is powered by Vercel serverless functions (`api/`) over a **Neon Postgres** database.
**Until a database is connected it transparently falls back to clearly-labeled sample data**, so the
app runs without any backend.

To enable live data:

1. In the Vercel dashboard, go to **Storage → Neon** and add the integration (this sets `DATABASE_URL`).
2. Apply the schema: `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f db/schema.sql`
3. Download the DOL/USCIS files (links above), export to CSV, and load them:
   ```bash
   node db/ingest.mjs lca   path/to/LCA_FY2024.csv   "FY2024 Q3"
   node db/ingest.mjs perm  path/to/PERM_FY2024.csv  "FY2024 Q3"
   node db/ingest.mjs uscis path/to/hub_FY2024.csv   "FY2024"
   ```

For local development, put the Neon connection string in `.env` as `DATABASE_URL` (see `.env.example`).

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**
- **Mapbox Account** - [Sign up for free](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) to get your API token

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ankitjawla/
cd H1B_Wage_Tracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required dependencies including:
- React 18.3.1
- Mapbox GL JS 3.5.0
- Vite 5.4.0
- Vercel Analytics 1.6.1
- PropTypes 15.8.1 (for runtime prop validation)

### 3. Configure Mapbox Token

The application requires a Mapbox access token to display the interactive map. Follow these steps:

1. **Get your Mapbox token:**
   - Sign up for a free account at [Mapbox](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/)
   - Navigate to your [Account page](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/)
   - Copy your default public token or create a new one

2. **Create environment file:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project:

   ```bash
   touch .env
   ```

3. **Add your Mapbox token:**
   Open the `.env` file and add your token:

   ```env
   VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
   ```

   Replace `your_mapbox_token_here` with your actual Mapbox access token.

   **Note:** The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore`, so your token won't be committed to version control.

### 4. Run the Application

#### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot module replacement:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port). The dev server automatically reloads when you make changes to the code.

#### Build for Production

Create an optimized production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a `dist` folder with optimized and minified files ready for deployment.

#### Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This serves the production build locally so you can test it before deploying.

## 📖 How to Use

1. **Select an Occupation**: 
   - Use the autocomplete search to find your job title or SOC code
   - The search supports both job titles (e.g., "Software Developer") and SOC codes (e.g., "15-1132")
   - If you can't find your exact job title, try searching with a broader or more common job title

2. **Enter Your Salary**: 
   - Input your annual base salary in the salary field
   - The application automatically calculates the hourly rate (assuming 2080 hours per year)

3. **Explore the Map**: 
   - Counties are color-coded based on which wage level your salary falls under
   - Click on any county to see detailed information including:
     - County name and state
     - Wage level (I, II, III, or IV)
     - Level description (Entry, Qualified, Experienced, or Fully Competent)

4. **View Statistics**: 
   - The statistics panel shows how many counties match each wage level
   - This helps you understand the geographic distribution of wage levels for your occupation and salary

## 🎨 Wage Levels

The application uses four wage levels as defined by the Department of Labor, displayed with a blue color palette:

- **Level I (Entry)**: Entry-level wage - Light Blue (`#DBEAFE`)
- **Level II (Qualified)**: Qualified wage - Medium Blue (`#60A5FA`)
- **Level III (Experienced)**: Experienced wage - Darker Blue (`#2563EB`)
- **Level IV (Fully Competent)**: Fully competent wage - Darkest Blue (`#1E3A8A`)

Counties without data or where your salary is below Level I are shown in gray (`#F3F4F6`).
